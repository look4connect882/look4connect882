##👋 Hi, I’m @look4connect882
##👀 I’m interested in building meaningful tech connections, solving real-world problems with code, and helping people maintain and improve their web presence.
##🌱 I’m currently learning more about open-source collaboration, efficient web tooling, and ways to work smarter with limited time.
##💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small-to-mid-sized projects where someone needs a reliable “tech handyman” — flexible, fast-learning, and ready to help with anything from bug fixes to redesigns.
##😄 Pronouns: he/him
##⚡ Fun fact: I’ve been programming since I was 11, and I still love finding clean, simple solutions to messy problems.



I'm a tech generalist with a deep background in computers and a flexible, no-nonsense approach to getting things done. Whether it's maintaining legacy code, modernizing a website, or jumping into unfamiliar systems, I adapt fast and focus on solving problems that matter.

## 💼 What I Do
- **Website Maintenance & Revamps** — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- **Tech Cleanup & Debugging** — Fixing messy codebases and restoring order
- **Volunteer Support** — Helping mission-driven orgs with practical tech needs

## 🧠 How I Work
- **Quick to learn, quick to ship** — I don't need handholding.
- **Straightforward communication** — Clarity over jargon.
- **Reliable output** — I take pride in doing a thorough job.

## 🤝 Let's Connect
If you’re looking for someone adaptable and dependable for small or ongoing technical tasks:

- 📧 **Email:**  KaiGray [.] prof (!ат!) outlook (|cом|)
- 🌐 **Resume + Rate Sheet:** [Available on request]

Alternatively, open an issue or discussion on any repo — I check GitHub frequently.
